      <h2>Installing Packages</h2>
      <h3>Installing Anaconda</h3>

      <p>
        As first step, download the Anaconda package manager from https://www.anaconda.com. Then follow the installer UI
        instructions. After a successful installation, open Anaconda-Navigator App.
      </p>
      <h3>Installing Jupyter Notebook</h3>

      <p>
        From the Anaconda-Navigator, click on Jupyter Notebook Lauch button. Jupyter Notebook will be installed and a
        webpage will be opend. From now on , you can lauch Jupyter notebook from commandline by typing jypyter-notebook.

      <h2>Machine Learning</h2>

      <p>
        Machine Learning Specialization from Andrew NG is a good reference to understand the basics of Machine learning.

        programmed" - Arutur Samuel 1959

      <h2>Supervised Machine Learning- Regression</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The key characteristic of a supervised learning is that you give your learning algorithm examples to learn
          from.
        </li>
        <li>These alorithms help to learn input X to output Y mapping</li>
        <li>
          Examples
          <ul>
            <li>Smapl filters: X= Email ; Y = Spam (0/1)</li>
            <li>Speech recognition: X = Audio ; Y = Transcript</li>
            <li>Machine Translation: X = Englisg; Y = Spanish</li>
            <li>Online advertising : X = Ad, User-information ; Y = Click (0/1)</li>
            <li>Self driving car: X = Image, RadarInput; Y = Position of other cars</li>
            <li>Visual Inspection: X= Image of Phone ; Y = Detect (0/1)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          In all these applications, you will train your model with examples of input X and the expected answers Y
          (labels)
        </li>
        <li>Example of Housing price based on known data</li>
      </ul>

        <figcaption>Housing Price Data(credit Andrew NG).</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Now we have to predict housing price for a new input , say 1200 which is not in the data that we have. You
          need to find a mathematic function that best fit the data given.
          <ul>
            <li>
              For doing this, you need to decide a straight line, a curve or another function that is even more complex
              for the data.
            </li>
            <li>You also need an algorithm to choose the correct function to fit this data.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          This housing price prediction is the particular type of supervised learning called regression. In regression
          we are trying to predict a number from infinitely many possible numbers, which could be 150,000 or 70,000 or
          183,000 or any other number in between.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Supervised Machine Learning- Classification</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Here predict only a small number of output categories (0 or 1 in this case) unlike regression where there are
          infinitely many.
        </li>
        <li>
          Classification predicts categories. It need not to be numbers - it can be non numeric also (predict cat or
          dog).
        </li>
        <li>Example : Identify if given tumor size is benign or not.</li>
        <li>X= input parameters ; Y = Classes or Categories.</li>
        <li>
          Classification can be more than 2 classes. For example, input parameter is the tumor size, and output classes
          are benign, malignant type1, and type2.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <figure>
        <img src="classification_multi_class.png" alt="Housing Price Data" width="400" height="100" />
        <figcaption>Single input, Multi class output (credit Andrew NG).</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>You can have also have multiple inputput paramters (X) like age, tumor size.</li>
      </ul>
      <figure>
        <img src="classification_multi_input_multi_class.png" alt="Housing Price Data" width="400" height="279" />
        <figcaption>Multi input, multi class output (credit Andrew NG).</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <ul>
        <li>
          To do this, algorithm finds some boundary that separates out malignant from benign ones. So the learning
          algorithm has to decide how to fit a boundary line through this data
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Unsupervised learning - Clustering</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>After supervised learning, the most widely used form of machine learning is unsupervised learning</li>
        <li>
          In unsupervised learning we are given data that isn't associated with any output labels Y. We dont mark the
          "right answers" for training the model. We're not asked to diagnose whether the tumor is benign or malignant,
          because we're not given any labels . Instead, we asked the algorithm to figure out all by yourself what's
          interesting. The algorithm will output the clusters it sees. This is a particular type of unsupervised
          learning, called a clustering algorithm that helps to find structure in the data given.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <figure>
        <img src="unsupervised_clustering.png" alt="Clustering" width="400" height="250" />
        <figcaption>Clustering (credit Andrew NG).</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <ul>
        <li>
          For example google news groups related news together. This is achived through clustering algorithms. The
          clustering algorithm figures out what words to use to form a cluster. It can also be used for grouping
          customers.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Unsupervised learning - Dimensionality Reduction</h2>

      <ul>
        <li> Dimensionality reduction lets you take a big data-set and almost magically compress it to a much smaller data-set while losing as little information as possible</li>
      </ul>
