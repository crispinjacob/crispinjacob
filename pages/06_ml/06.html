      <h2>Supervised Machine Learning- Regression</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The key characteristic of a supervised learning is that you give your learning algorithm examples to learn
          from.
        </li>
        <li>These alorithms help to learn input X to output Y mapping</li>
        <li>
          Examples
          <ul>
            <li>Smapl filters: X= Email ; Y = Spam (0/1)</li>
            <li>Speech recognition: X = Audio ; Y = Transcript</li>
            <li>Machine Translation: X = Englisg; Y = Spanish</li>
            <li>Online advertising : X = Ad, User-information ; Y = Click (0/1)</li>
            <li>Self driving car: X = Image, RadarInput; Y = Position of other cars</li>
            <li>Visual Inspection: X= Image of Phone ; Y = Detect (0/1)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          In all these applications, you will train your model with examples of input X and the expected answers Y
          (labels)
        </li>
        <li>Example of Housing price based on known data</li>
      </ul>

      <figure>
        <img src="regression_housing_price_prediction.png" alt="Housing Price Data" width="500" height="300" />
        <figcaption>Housing Price Data(credit Andrew NG).</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Now we have to predict housing price for a new input , say 1200 which is not in the data that we have. You
          need to find a mathematic function that best fit the data given.
          <ul>
            <li>
              For doing this, you need to decide a straight line, a curve or another function that is even more complex
              for the data.
            </li>
            <li>You also need an algorithm to choose the correct function to fit this data.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          This housing price prediction is the particular type of supervised learning called regression. In regression
          we are trying to predict a number from infinitely many possible numbers, which could be 150,000 or 70,000 or
          183,000 or any other number in between.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Supervised Machine Learning- Classification</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Here predict only a small number of output categories (0 or 1 in this case) unlike regression where there are
          infinitely many.
        </li>
        <li>
          Classification predicts categories. It need not to be numbers - it can be non numeric also (predict cat or
          dog).
        </li>
        <li>Example : Identify if given tumor size is benign or not.</li>
        <li>X= input parameters ; Y = Classes or Categories.</li>
        <li>
          Classification can be more than 2 classes. For example, input parameter is the tumor size, and output classes
          are benign, malignant type1, and type2.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <figure>
        <img src="classification_multi_class.png" alt="Housing Price Data" width="400" height="100" />
        <figcaption>Single input, Multi class output (credit Andrew NG).</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>You can have also have multiple inputput paramters (X) like age, tumor size.</li>
      </ul>
      <figure>
        <img src="classification_multi_input_multi_class.png" alt="Housing Price Data" width="400" height="279" />

      </figure>

      <ul>
        <li>
          To do this, algorithm finds some boundary that separates out malignant from benign ones. So the learning
          algorithm has to decide how to fit a boundary line through this data
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Unsupervised learning - Clustering</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>After supervised learning, the most widely used form of machine learning is unsupervised learning</li>
        <li>
          In unsupervised learning we are given data that isn't associated with any output labels Y. We dont mark the
          "right answers" for training the model. We're not asked to diagnose whether the tumor is benign or malignant,
          because we're not given any labels . Instead, we asked the algorithm to figure out all by yourself what's
          interesting. The algorithm will output the clusters it sees. This is a particular type of unsupervised
          learning, called a clustering algorithm that helps to find structure in the data given.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <figure>
        <img src="unsupervised_clustering.png" alt="Clustering" width="400" height="250" />
        <figcaption>Clustering (credit Andrew NG).</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <ul>
        <li>
          For example google news groups related news together. This is achived through clustering algorithms. The
          clustering algorithm figures out what words to use to form a cluster. It can also be used for grouping
          customers.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Unsupervised learning - Dimensionality Reduction</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Dimensionality reduction lets you take a big data-set and almost magically compress it to a much smaller
          data-set while losing as little information as possible
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>More on Linear Regression</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Linear regression is defined as an algorithm that provides a linear relationship between an independent
          variable (Y) and a dependent variable (X) to predict the outcome of future events. A sloped straight line
          represents the linear regression model
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Linear regression with 1 variable</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          To train the model, you feed the training set, both the input features and the output targets to your learning
          algorithm. Then your supervised learning algorithm will produce some function. Historically, this function
          used to be called a hypothesis, let us call it a function f . The job with f is to take a new input X and
          output , and a prediction, which is called Y-hat. In machine learning, the convention is that y-hat is the
          estimate or the prediction for y.
        </li>
        <li>
          The function f is called the model. X is called the input or the input feature and the output of the model is
          the prediction, Y-hat
        </li>

        <li>
          When the symbol is just the letter Y, then that refers to the target, which is the actual true value in the
          training set. In contrast, Y-hat is an estimate. It may or may not be the actual true value.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your model f, given the size, outputs the price which is the estimator, that is the prediction of what the
          true price will be.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>How are we going to represent the function f?</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="f_representation.png" alt="Clustering" width="320" height="200" />
        <figcaption>Representaion of f - Linear Regression with One Variable (credit Andrew NG).</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <ul>
        <li>
          This function is making predictions for the value of Y using a straight-line function of X. Sometimes you want
          to fit more complex non-linear functions as well, like a curve. A linear function is relatively simple and
          easy to work with, and will help you to get to more complex models that are non-linear.
        </li>
        <li>
          Above function has a single input variable or feature X, namely the size of the house. This is called a
          univariate linear regression.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Cost Function</h2>
      <p>
        The idea of a cost function is one of the most universal and important ideas in machine learning, and is used in
        both linear regression and in training many of the most advanced AI models in the world. Take an example of
        below dataset:
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src="training_set_feet_vs_price.png" alt="Clustering" width="320" height="200" />
        <figcaption>Training set (credit Andrew NG).</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Checking visually with scatterplots or statistically using correlation coefficients we can see that there is a
        linear relationship between the independent variables (x) and the dependent variable (y). So linear regression
        could be a choice. In order to implement linear regression the first key step is first to define a cost
        function. Cost function will tell us how well the model is doing so that we can try to get it to do better
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src="training_set_feet_vs_price_model.png" alt="Clustering" width="320" height="200" />
        <figcaption>Model (credit Andrew NG).</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The model we are going to choose is a function above, where w and b are parameters (coefficients / weights).
        Depending on the values you've chosen for w and b you get a different function f of x, which generates a
        different line on the graph
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>f(x) = 0x + 1.5</li>
        <li>f(x) = 0.5x + 0</li>
        <li>f(x) = 0.5x + 1</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        With linear regression, you want choose values for the parameters w and b so that the straight line you get from
        the function f somehow fits the data well
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src="training_set_feet_vs_price_fitted.png" alt="Clustering" width="320" height="200" />
        <figcaption>Fitted Model (credit Andrew NG).</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>Finding values for w and b</h3>
      <p>How to automatically find the value of w and b? From the training data you have:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>y<sup>(1)</sup> , x<sup>(1)</sup></li>
        <li>y<sup>(2)</sup> , x<sup>(2)</sup></li>
        <li>y<sup>(3)</sup> , x<sup>(3)</sup></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Predicting the the values (ŷ) using the model formula y= w*x + b :</p>

      <ul>
        <li>ŷ<sup>(1)</sup> = x<sup>(1)</sup> + b</li>
        <li>ŷ<sup>(2)</sup> = x<sup>(2)</sup> + b</li>
        <li>ŷ<sup>(3)</sup> = x<sup>(3)</sup> + b</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In above formula you used one of the w and b values. There are other w and b values you have to try. You have to
        find values for w and b so that the the prediction ŷ is close to the y, for all training examples. To do that,
        you need to construct a cost function.
