      <h1>Digital Certificates</h1>

      <p>16 March 2025</p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Digital Certificates are one of the foundation blocks of security in digital world. They are used to
        authenticate the identity of the device and secure the transactions between devices. This section provides an
        overview of the digital certificates.
      </p>
      <p>Let us dive into few concepts:</p>

      <!-- Basic concepts of encryption in cryptography -->

      <h2>Symmetric key cryptography</h2>
      <p>In Symmetric key cryptography same key is used to encrypt and decrypt.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Advantage: They are faster to encrypt and decrypt</li>
        <li>Disadvantage: The secret key has to be shared between the sender and receiver.</li>
      </ul>

      s
      <p>
        Secure key distribution is a major problem to be solved, and this is where the Asymmetric key cryptography
        excells
      </p>

      <h2>Asymmetric key cryptography (public key cryptography)</h2>

      <p>
        Asymmetric key cryptography solves the above mentioned key distribution problem by using 2 keys (key pair)
        instead of a single shared key.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>One of the keys is kept secret - private key</li>
        <li>Other key is made public - public key</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        There are different algorithm choices available for asymmetric key cryptography. Some of the popular ones are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          RSA - Rivest–Shamir–Adleman.
          <ul>
            <li>Most suited for communication encryption</li>
            <li>Based on difficulty of Prime factorization</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          DSA - Digital Signature Algorithm
          <ul>
            <li>Most suited for signing (encrypting hash) and verification</li>
            <li>Based on difficulty of discrete logarithm</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          ECC- Elliptic Curve Cryptography
          <ul>
            <li>Greater cryptographic strengh for equivalent key size in RSA/DSA</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Some algorithms like RSA technically allows YOU to choose which key is private and which is public. But some
        others like ECC does not give you a choice as they are dissimilar in computation.
      </p>
      <p></p>

      <h2>Hybrid approach</h2>
      <p>
        The Asymetric encryption is computationally heavy (could be 1000s of times heavy) as compared to the symmetric
        encryption. In practical usecases a hybrid approach is used where public key cryptography is used for securely
        sharing symmetric key. After this initial step, the symmetric key is used always.
      </p>
      <p>Majority of the communication encryption usecases follows a hybrid approch.</p>

      <h2>Assumetric encryption - Key aspects</h2>

      <h3>Sharing</h3>
      <p></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Public keys can be shared to anyone publicly. There is no secrecy involved here.</li>
        <li>Private keys are not shared with anyone else.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Public keys can be shared via different mechanisms . For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Manually via email or similar mechanisms</li>
        <li>Using a protocol, like TLS</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Oneway Encryption</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>If public key is used to encrypt the message, only the private key can be used to decrypt the message.</li>
        <li>If private key is used to encrypt the message, only the public key can be used to decrypt the message.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Alice shares public key to rest of the world including Bob. Bob uses it to encrypt data and send to Alice. Alice
        decrypts with private key. Nobody else can decrypt it since they don't have private key
      </p>

      <h3>Jac plays the trick</h3>

      <p>
        Jac can access Alice's public key since it is shared to the world. Jac uses Alice's public key and sends Alice a
        message impersonating Bob "Hello, I am Bob !". Alice will be able to decrypt it with her private key. Alice
        thinks it came from Bob, and may respond to him!
      </p>
      <p>
        To avoid this, digital signatures are used. Bob signs the message using Bobs private key. Alice always uses Bobs
        shared public key to verify the signature. Now Jac cannot impersonate Bob since Jac don't have Bobs private key
        to sign the message.
      </p>

      <p>
        A protocol like TLS includes the full mechanism to handle all these aspects using digital signatures. To know
        more about TLS, visit: below article:
      </p>
      <p><a href="../03/03.html">TLS Explained</a></p>

      <p>
        ssl library performs the verification of certificate date, CA signature verification by default. This is part of
        TLS handshake protocol specficcation.
      </p>
      <p>
        A check is required to ensure that the domain mentioned in the certificate and the domain is used in the
        connection is matching. This check is not part of TLS protocol, but it is avalable as part of the ssl libraries.
        During the TLS connection establishment time, ssl library is given in the input parameter of the domain or IP to
        validate against. When the digital certificate is downloaded as part of the TLS handshake, ssl library checks
        the download IP and IP mentioned in the certificate is matching. Certificate validation will be failiing if not
        matching. This is an optional feature of the ssl library.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly a certificate revocation checks are also done in ssl library, but it is not part of the TLS protocol.
      </p>
      <h3>What is a digital certificate ?</h3>

      <p>A digital certificate is a file that contains following compoenents:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Public Key</li>
        <li>Digital signature of the certificate hash</li>
        <li>Asymmetric encryption algorithm used</li>
        <li>Hashing and Signature Algorithm used, like sha256RSA</li>
        <li>Certificate version</li>
        <li>Issuer - Name of the CA that issued and signed the certificate</li>
        <li>Subject - Subject to which this certificate is assigned</li>
        <li>And more ...</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Digital certificate standard</h3>
     <p> X509 is a standard for publick key digital certificate. All X509 objects are represented in Abstract Syntax
       Notation One as a byte array. </p>

      <h3>Digital certificate file encoding formats</h3>
      <p>Below are the popular certificate file formats:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>PEM - X509 in ASCII format (Base64 encoded)</li>
        <li>DER - X509 in binary format (ASN1 encoded in binary)</li>
        <li>
          PKCS12 - A password-protected container format that contains both public and private certificate pairs. It is
          fully encrypted. This can contain private key and certificate chain material. This is a Microsoft standard.
        </li>

        <li>PKCS7 - Does not contain private key material. This is a Java open standard</li>

        <li>CER - Windows certificate file name in PEM or DER format. Only extension is changed</li>
        <li>CRT - Unix certificate file name in PEM or DER format. Only extension is changed</li>
        <li>And more ...</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Common types of digital certificates</h3>
      <p>
        Although underlying technology is the same, there are different types of digital certificates depending on the
        use
