      <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Distributed Ledger
          <ul>
            <li>A copy of the data (the “ledger”) is stored across many nodes (computers).</li>
            <li>No central authority — everyone shares the same source of truth</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Decentralization
          <ul>
            <li>No single party controls the network</li>
            <li>Decisions, validation, and storage are spread across many participants</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Block
          <ul>
            <li>A block = a container of data.</li>
            <li>Transactions, Timestamp, Previous block’s hash, Nonce (if using Proof of Work)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Chain
          <ul>
            <li>Blocks are linked together using cryptographic hashes</li>
            <li>Each block points to the previous one — making it tamper-evident</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Hashing
          <ul>
            <li>A hash is a fixed-length fingerprint of data</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Consensus Mechanism
          <ul>
            <li>A method for all nodes to agree on the state of the blockchain.</li>
            <li>
              Proof of Work (PoW) – Bitcoin, energy intensive, Proof of Stake (PoS) – Ethereum 2.0, eco-friendly,
              Others: DPoS, PoA, PBFT
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Immutability
          <ul>
            <li>
              Once data is added to the blockchain, it's almost impossible to change. This protects against fraud and
              revisionism
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Transparency
          <ul>
            <li>Most blockchains are public — anyone can verify any transaction</li>
            <li>Great for trustless systems and audits</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Smart Contracts
          <ul>
            <li>Self-executing code stored on the blockchain</li>
            <li>Runs when certain conditions are met (e.g., on Ethereum)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Distributed Ledger</h2>

      <p>
        A Distributed Ledger is a database that is shared and synchronized across multiple computers (called nodes) in
        different locations. Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger. Every node in the blockchain network has a full
        copy of the ledgerNew entries are added only when most nodes agree (consensus).
      </p>
      <p>
        For example , As 2025, the Bitcoin network comprises approximately 21,698 publicly reachable nodes. In addition
        to these, there are an estimated 62,391 total nodes on the Bitcoin network. This figure includes both publicly
        reachable nodes and those that are not directly accessible, such as nodes operating behind firewalls or using
        privacy networks like Tor
      </p>
      <p>
        Bitcoin nodes communicate with each other using the Bitcoin P2P (peer-to-peer) protocol, which is a custom
        application-layer protocol designed specifically for the Bitcoin network
      </p>

      <p>
        Joining a distributed network like a blockchain (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) is actually quite straightforward —
        but it depends on your role: do you want to be a full node, light client, or just interact via a wallet or app?
      </p>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Choose the Network - Bitcoin, Ethereum, ...</li>

        <li>Install Node Software - Bitcoin Core, Nethermind, Solana Validator ..</li>
        <li>Connect to Peers - The node automatically connects to peer nodes using built-in discovery protocols</li>
        <li>
          Download the Ledger (if full node)
          <ul>
            <li>Full nodes download the entire blockchain from peers</li>
            <li>This can take hours or days depending on network (e.g., Bitcoin ~500GB+)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Start Participating
          <ul>
            <li>Validate transactions & blocks (if a validator or miner)</li>
            <li>Relay data to others (as a full node)</li>
            <li>Interact with dApps and smart contracts</li>
            <li>Submit your own transactions</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Type of nodes</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Full Node
          <ul>
            <li>Stores the entire blockchain, validates transactions & blocks independently</li>
            <li>Examples: Bitcoin Core, Geth (Ethereum)</li>
            <li>Pros: High trust, no need to rely on others</li>
            <li>Cons: Requires a lot of storage & bandwidth</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Light Node / SPV Node
          <ul>
            <li>Downloads only block headers, not full blocks</li>
            <li>Verifies transactions by asking full nodes for proof</li>
            <li>Common in mobile wallets</li>
            <li>Pros: Lightweight, fast</li>
            <li>Cons: Must trust full nodes for data</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Mining Node / Validator Node
          <ul>
            <li>Special full nodes that produce new blocks</li>
            <li>
              Bitcoin: Mining nodes solve PoW puzzles, Ethereum 2.0 & others: Validators stake coins to propose/validate
              blocks (PoS)
            </li>
            <li>Pros: Can earn rewards</li>
            <li>Cons: Needs powerful hardware or stake</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Archive Node
          <ul>
            <li>mainly in Ethereum</li>
            <li>Stores entire blockchain + historical states</li>
            <li>Keeps every version of every smart contract & account</li>
            <li>Used for debugging, explorers, analytics</li>
            <li>Pros: Deep data access</li>
            <li>Cons: Huge storage requirements (TBs)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Masternode
          <ul>
            <li>Special node with extra roles (e.g., private txs, instant sends)</li>
            <li>Requires collateral to run (e.g., 1000 DASH)</li>
            <li>Pros: Passive income, governance rights</li>
            <li>Cons: Locked capital, centralized concerns</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Hidden Nodes / Tor Nodes
          <ul>
            <li>Operate anonymously (e.g., over Tor)</li>
            <li>Not publicly listed but still participate in the network</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Blockchain</h3>
      <p>
        Blockchain is a special kind of database that stores data in a series of linked blocks, and it's designed to be
        secure, transparent, and tamper-proof. Each block is like a page in a ledger — and they’re chained together in
        order, forming a growing history that’s nearly impossible to change.
      </p>
      <p>Working simplified:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A transaction happens- Alice sends 2 coins to Bob</li>
        <li>It gets broadcasted to a network - A bunch of computers (called nodes) hear about it</li>
        <li>
          The network validates the transaction - Usually through consensus algorithms (like Proof of Work or Proof of
          Stake)
        </li>
        <li>Valid transactions are grouped into a block</li>
        <li>The block is added to the chain, referencing the previous block's hash (a fingerprint)</li>
        <li>
          Now the blockchain has a new entry, and it’s immutable (can’t be changed without breaking the whole chain)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Important notes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Each block contains a hash of the previous block</li>
        <li>Tampering with one block would break the chain</li>
        <li>The ledger is replicated across many nodes, so it’s decentralized and resilient</li>
        <li>Modern blockchains also use cryptographic signatures</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Mining</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Mining is how new entries (blocks) are securely added to that ledger</li>
        <li>Blockchain = the history</li>
        <li>Mining = the process that secures and extends that history</li>
        <li>
          Mining is the process of validating transactions, grouping them into a block, and adding that block to the
          blockchain — in a secure, tamper-proof way
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Working:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>New transactions are broadcast to the network</li>
        <li>Miners gather them into a block</li>
        <li>
          They race to solve a puzzle - Find a nonce that makes the block’s hash meet a target (e.g., starts with many
          zeroes).
        </li>
        <li>First miner to solve it broadcasts the block</li>
        <li>Other nodes verify the block and add it to the chain</li>
        <li>That miner earns A block reward (e.g., Bitcoin), Transaction fees</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The time it takes to mine a block depends on the blockchain protocol — it’s actually deliberately controlled to
        maintain network stability and security. Mining time is not random — it’s intentionally controlled by the
        blockchain protocol.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Bitcoin ~10 minutes. Bitcoin’s 10-minute block time was chosen by Satoshi to: Allow decentralized miners to
          compete fairly, Create a predictable supply of BTC (every ~4 years → halving)
        </li>
        <li>Dogecoin ~2.5 minutes</li>
        <li>Solana - ~0.4 seconds</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Too fast = More forks, more bandwidth usage, harder to reach consensus. Too slow = delays in transaction
        confirmation
      </p>
      <h2>Bitcoin</h2>
      <p>
        Bitcoin ≠ Blockchain. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, Blockchain is the technology that powers Bitcoin (and many
        other things too like NFTs, Medical records, Voting systems, Smart contracts like Ethereum).
