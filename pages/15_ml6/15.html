    <h2>Making recommendations</h2>

    <p>
      The user can rate the move from 0 to 5 stars. if you have features for each movie, the algorithm tells how much is
      this a romance movie and how much is this an action movie. Then you can use basically linear regression to learn
      to predict movie ratings.

    <p>But what if you don't have those features?</p>

      We can try to guess what might be reasonable features for movies. Alice rated movie one, 5, we should have that w
      <sup>(1)</sup>.x<sup>(1)</sup> should be about equal to 5 and w <sup>(2)</sup>.x<sup>(2)</sup> should also be
      about equal to 5 because Bob rated it 5. w <sup>(3)</sup>.x<sup>(1)</sup> should be close to 0 andw
      <sup>(4)</sup>.x<sup>(1)</sup> should be close to 0 as well. The question is, given these values for w that we
      have up here, what choice for x<sup>(1)</sup> will cause these values to be right?

    <p>
      In collaborative filtering, you have ratings from multiple users of the same item with the same movie. That's what
      makes it possible to guess what are possible values for these features
    </p>

    <p>
      For most machine learning applications the features had to be externally given. But in this algorithm, we can
      actually learn the features for a given movie
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p>
      The name collaborative filtering refers that multiple users have rated the same movie collaboratively given you a
      sense of what this movie maybe like. This allows you to guess what are appropriate features for that movie. This
      in turn allows you to predict how other users that haven't yet rated that same movie may decide to rate it in the
      future. A very common use case of recommender systems is when you have binary labels such as that the user favors,
      or like, or interact with an item.
    </p>
    <h2>Binary labels: favs, likes and clicks</h2>
    <p>
      Many important applications of recommender systems or collective filtering algorithms involved binary labels,
      where instead of a user giving you a one to five star or zero to five star rating, they just give you a sense of
      they like this item or not. The process we'll use to generalize the algorithm will be very much reminiscent to how
      we have gone from linear regression to logistic regression, to predicting numbers to predicting a binary label.
    </p>
    <h2>Mean normalization</h2>

    <p>
      You normalize the movie ratings to have a consistent average value. Add a fifth user Eve who has not yet rated any
      movies:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="user_eve.png" alt="" width="800" height="400" />
      <figcaption>(credit Andrew NG).</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      To carry out mean normalization we take all of these ratings and for each movie, compute the average rating that
      was given. We can use TensorFlow to implement the collaborative filtering algorithm. It's a great tool for
      building neural networks. Nut TensorFlow can also be very helpful for building other types of learning algorithms
      as well, like the collaborative filtering algorithm.
    </p>
    <p>
      For many applications in order to implement gradient descent, you need to find the derivatives of the cost
      function, but TensorFlow can automatically figure out for you what are the derivatives of the cost function. All
      you have to do is implement the cost function and without needing to know any calculus, without needing to take
      derivatives yourself, you can get TensorFlow with just a few lines of code to compute that derivative term, that
      can be used to optimize the cost function.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
      This is a very powerful feature of TensorFlow called Auto Diff. And some other machine learning packages like
      pytorch also support Auto Diff (Auto Grad) for automatically taking derivatives. once you can compute derivatives
      automatically, you're not limited to just gradient descent. You can also use a more powerful optimization
      algorithm, like the adam optimization algorithm.

    <p>Content based filtering - Recommend items to you based on features of user and item to find good match</p>

    <p>
      To summarize, in collaborative filtering, we had number of users give ratings of different items. In contrast, in
      content-based filtering, we have features of users and features of items, and we want to find a way to find good
      matches between the users and the items
    </p>

    <h3>Deep learning for content-based filtering</h3>
    <p>A good way to develop a content-based filtering algorithm is to use deep learning.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="nn_for_content_filter.png" alt="" width="700" height="400" />
      <figcaption>(credit Andrew NG).</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>We need to train all the parameters of both the user network and the movie network.</p>

    <h3>Reducing the number of features</h3>
    <p>
      PCA, or principal components analysis is an algorithm that lets you take data with a lot of features (for example
      50, 1000, or more) and reduce the number of features to two or three features, so that you can plot it and
      visualize it.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="car_measurements.png" alt="" width="700" height="400" />
      <figcaption>(credit Andrew NG).</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>In the example only one of the two features seems to have a meaningful degree of variation</p>
    <h2>Reinforcement Learning</h2>

    <p>
      Programming a helicopter - In reinforcement learning, we get the position, orientation, speed of the helicopter
      (the state s). Our task is to find a function that maps from the state of the helicopter to an action a, meaning
      how far to push the two control sticks in order to keep the helicopter balanced in the air and flying and without
      crashing
    </p>

    <p>
      One way you could attempt this problem is to use supervised learning. It turns out this is not a great approach
      for autonomous helicopter flying. The supervised learning approach doesn't work well and we instead use
      reinforcement learning. The key input to a reinforcement learning is something called the reward or the reward
      function which tells the helicopter when it's doing well and when it's doing poorly.
    </p>

    <p>
      How do you know if a particular set of rewards is better or worse than a different set of rewards? The return in
      reinforcement learning allows us to capture that.
