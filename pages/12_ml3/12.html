    <h2>Neural networks</h2>

    <p>
      When neural networks were first invented many decades ago, the original motivation was to write software that
      could mimic how the human brain or how the biological brain learns and thinks. Work in neural networks had started
      back in the 1950s.

    <p>
      When you're building an artificial neural network or deep learning algorithm, rather than building one neuron at a
      time, you often simulate many such neurons at the same time
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p>
      Those of us that do research in deep learning have shifted away from looking to biological motivation that much.
      But instead, they're just using engineering principles to figure out how to build algorithms that are more
      effective.
    </p>

    <p>Let us use an example from demand prediction</p>

      Let us use the alphabet “a” to denote the output of this logistic regression algorithm. The term a stands for
      activation, and it's a term from neuroscience. It refers to how much a neuron is sending a high output to other
      neurons downstream from it.
    </p>

    <p>
      This unit of logistic regression algorithm, can be thought of as a very simplified model of a single neuron in the
      brain. Building a neural network now it just requires taking a bunch of these neurons and wiring them together or
      putting them together. A layer is a grouping of neurons which takes as input the same or similar features, and
      that in turn outputs a few numbers together.
    </p>

    <p>Hidden Layer</p>

    <p>
      Your data set tells you what is x and what is y. ie, you have information on the correct inputs and the correct
      outputs. But your dataset doesn't tell you what are the correct values for affordability, awareness, and perceived
      quality. The correct values for those are hidden. You don't see them in the training set, which is why this layer
      in the middle is called a hidden layer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The input layer has a vector of features (four numbers in this example) it is input to the hidden layer, which
      outputs three numbers.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p>
      When you're building your own neural network, one of the decisions you need to make is how many hidden layers do
      you want and how many neurons do you want each hidden layer to have. It is a question of the architecture of the
      neural network. But choosing the right number of hidden layers and number of hidden units per layer can have an
      impact on the performance of a learning algorithm as well.
    </p>

    <p>The term multilayer perceptron just refers to a neural network that looks like the above.</p>

    <h3>Recognizing Images</h3>
    <p>
      For building a face recognition application, you will train a neural network that takes as input a picture and
      outputs the identity of the person in the picture. This image example is 1,000 by 1,000 pixels. It is a 1000 by
      1000 matrix of pixel intensity values.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="1000_x_1000.png" alt="" width="450" height="300" />
      <figcaption>Input Image (credit Andrew NG).</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      If you were to take these pixel intensity values and unroll them into a vector, you end up with a list or a vector
      of a million (1000x1000) pixel intensity values. The face recognition problem is thus about training a neural
      network that takes as input a feature vector with a million pixel values and outputs the identity of the person in
      the picture
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first hidden layer, you might find one neuron that is looking for the low vertical line or a vertical edge
      . A second neuron looking for a oriented line or oriented edge . The third neuron looking for a line at that
      orientation, and so on. The neural network is aggregating different parts of faces to then try to detect presence
      or absence of larger, coarser face shapes
    </p>

    <p>
      The same learning algorithm is asked to detect cars, will then learn edges in the first layer. Pretty similar but
      then they'll learn to detect parts of cars in the second hidden layer and then more complete car shapes in the
      third hidden layer. Just by feeding it different data, the neural network automatically learns to detect very
      different features so as to try to make the predictions of car detection or person recognition.
